# 📖 Project Description

### What is our idea? GreenStep is a daily eco-habit tracking prototype that gamifies climate action. It allows users to easily log their daily environmentally friendly actions (such as taking public transit, bringing a reusable tumbler, or turning off unused lights) to earn points and visualize their personal carbon footprint reduction.

### Who does it help? This application is specifically designed for Taylor's University students and staff. Many students want to contribute to environmental sustainability but struggle to track their impact or stay motivated. GreenStep helps the campus community stay engaged in climate action through a simple, rewarding feedback loop.

# 📁 Repository Organization

### This repository is structured to reflect our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) progress. All project artifacts are organized into the following folders:

### 📁 /planning : Contains our project plan, Trello board links, initial backlog, product vision, and sprint planning notes.

### 📁 /design : Contains our UML Use Case diagrams, UI/UX sketches, and wireframes for the mobile layout.

### 📁 /testing : Contains prototype evaluation feedback, usability testing notes, and bug reports.

### 📁 /final : Contains final prototype screenshots, the final group presentation slides, and a summary of our results.

# 🔄 Overview of SDLC Work

# Our team followed an Agile/Scrum methodology over a 4-week period to develop this prototype.

### 1. Planning & Requirements: We identified SDG 13 as our focus, defined our target audience, and drafted our Product Vision. We utilized Trello to create our Product Backlog and planned our sprints using Agile user stories.
### 2. Analysis & Design: We used UML notation to map out the system boundaries and actor interactions via a Use Case Diagram. We then sketched a 4-screen mobile UI to ensure a seamless user experience.
### 3. Implementation (Prototyping): We developed a clickable frontend prototype focused on the core logging loop (Dashboard -> Log Activity -> View Points).
### 4. Testing & Evaluation: We conducted peer usability testing to gather feedback on the UI clarity and task flow, updating our prototype and burndown chart accordingly.
