# GreenStep
GreenStep is a simple daily habit-tracking prototype designed for Taylor's University students. It encourages climate action by allowing students to log eco-friendly daily activities (such as taking public transit or bringing reusable containers) to earn points and visualize their carbon footprint reduction.
